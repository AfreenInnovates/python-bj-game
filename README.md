In this game, the user receives two cards (numbers) and must decide whether to continue playing if the sum of the cards is below 21. If they choose to continue, they will be dealt another card. However, if the sum exceeds 21, the user loses the game. Conversely, if the sum is exactly 21, the user wins.
